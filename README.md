## Enhance an Existing Project - Fixing bugs, writing documentation, unit tests and auditing the performance of a someone elses codebase (2019)

### Project Overview

This project takes over an existing codebase of a todo app that has bugs, no documentation and no testing. The aim of the project is to understand the inner workings of the app, the purpose of each function within the app and write documentation about the app. Jasmine unit tests are implimented to understand where the bugs are manifesting. With this understanding, the bugs in the codebase can be fixed and a performance analysis is undertaken on the app, comparing the app to other competitors. With this analysis conclusions are drawn on improvements this app and how to best scale and build an app of our own.
